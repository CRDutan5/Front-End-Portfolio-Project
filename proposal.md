The API I will be using is the [Rick and Morty Api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to view how the characters look like so that I can familiarize myself with them.

As a user, I want to be able to filter characters based on the season they first appeared on, so I can form a timeline in my head of when the characters may have possibly crossed.



Extra Stuff:

As a user, I want to be able to select a single character so that I can learn more about.

As a user, I want to be able to filter characters based on their location of origin.
